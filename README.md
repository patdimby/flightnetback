# Hello Scalar! Bye, Swagger üëãüèº
This .NET package Scalar.AspNetCore provides an easy way to render beautiful API references based on OpenAPI/Swagger documents.

Made possible by the wonderful work of @captainsafia on building the integration and docs written for the Scalar & .NET integration. Thanks to @xC0dex for making it awesome.
Scalar is a tool that helps us create beautiful documentation for our APIs. Unlike the default Swagger documentation, which can feel a bit outdated, Scalar offers a fresh and modern UI for API documentation. Its clean design makes it easy for developers to find the APIs they need for testing.
